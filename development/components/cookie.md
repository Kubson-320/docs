# Cookie component

The `Cookie` component is in charge of managing everything that the PrestaShop stores in the `cookie` mechanism of the browser.
It helps set, get, and delete data stored in the `cookie` storage.

All information stored in the `Cookie` component is encrypted before being stored in the `cookie` mechanism for safety reasons. 

## Usage

### Retrieve a `Cookie` instance

A `Cookie` instance is available through [`Context`]({{< relref "/9/development/components/context">}}). 

To get a `Context` instance from a `Controller` subclass or a `Module` subclass, the `Context` should be called with this shortcut: 

```php
$this->context
```

From anywhere else, you can get the `Context` instance by calling:

```php
Context::getContext()
```

Once retrieved a `Context` instance, simply access `Cookie` with: 

```php
$context->cookie
```

### Set data in the `Cookie`

To set a cookie key with the name `mycookie` and the value `myvalue`, do the following: 

```php
$cookie = $this->context->cookie;
$cookie->mycookie = 'myvalue';
```

{{% notice note %}}
The `Cookie` component uses the [magic method `__set()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#object.set) to allow setting values to the object like they were public properties.

### Get data in the `Cookie` 

To get the cookie key with the name `mycookie`, do the following: 

```php
$cookie = $this->context->cookie;
$myCookieValue = $cookie->mycookie;
```

{{% notice note %}}
The `Cookie` component uses the [magic method `__get()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#object.get) to allow getting values to the object like they were public properties.

### Test if a cookie key exists in the `Cookie`

To test if a given key exists in the cookie exists, do the following: 

```php
$cookie = $this->context->cookie;
$cookieExists = isset($cookie->mycookie);
```

{{% notice note %}}
The `Cookie` component uses the [magic method `__isset()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#object.isset) to allow testing for existence values in the object like they were public properties. 
{{% /notice %}}

### Delete data in the `Cookie`

To delete the key with name `mycookie` from the PrestaShop's cookie, do the following: 

```php
$cookie = $this->context->cookie;
unset($cookie->mycookie);
```

{{% notice note %}}
The `Cookie` component uses the [magic method `__unset()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#object.unset) to allow unsetting values in the object like they were public properties.

## Limits

The `cookie` mechanism in browsers has some limitations about how much data you can put in. 

- According to [RFC 6265 (chapter 6.1)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6265/), browsers must support at least 50 `cookie` per domain and a minimum size of `4096 bytes (4kb)` per cookie (`cookie` name + value / attributes).

- PrestaShop will create only one cookie, in the `$_COOKIE` array, with each key and value data appended to a string and finally encrypted for safety reasons.

- Please note that most browsers will ignore the `cookie` if its size is superior to `4096 bytes`, which makes a limit around **1000 characters** before encryption.

If you need to store more information, you should consider using server-side storage such as `session` or `database`, or use browser-side storage such as [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
