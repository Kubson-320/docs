# Add or edit a carrier

Page can be reached by visiting `Shipping -> Carriers -> Add new carrier` in the admin panel or also by clicking on the `Edit` button in [the carriers listing](./../view-all-carriers).
It allows the Back Office user to edit or create a new carrier.

{{% notice %}}

When you edit a carrier, sometimes the data of the carrier is simply altered, sometimes a copy of the data is done, the previous data is de-activated but preserved, and your modifications are done on the new copy. This happens when a customer has purchased an order using this carrier, in order to preserve the carrier data as it was during the purchase.
