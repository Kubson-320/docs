# Using Vue.js

Depending on the PrestaShop version running on the shop, either on the back or the front-office,
at least one template renderer is available to display content on the page. With Javascript,
it is possible to update & animate the page content without having to refresh the page.

jQuery is available on PrestaShop to help implementing these interface updates.
For complex interfaces, with state management for instance, other frontend options could be considered.
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is a JavaScript Framework that will be helpful in this case.
This chapter covers its integration on a module.

{{% children /%}}

## 1- Creation of a Vue.js application in the module directories

The objective of this part is to make Vue.js available in the project. 

We will store the Vue.js source code in a dedicated folder that will be present in the module only
during the development part. Running Vue.js will be possible by compiling and storing the JS files
in the proper assets folder.

During this tutorial, we use a new folder `_dev` that will be created at the root directory of the module.

Installation of Vue.js can be done via [several ways](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html),
but we will use the CLI option to get all the stack.

* Installation of Vue.js CLI tool (globally)

```
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
```

* Creation of the project

```
$ vue create _dev
```

We chose the preset with Vue 2 & Babel for this tutorial.

After the initialization process with some questions and downloads, a whole standalone application
will be created and available in the `_dev` folder. Running npm commands are defined in the `package.json`
file to run or build it.

```
$ cd _dev
$ npm run build
```

At the moment, we have a Vue.js application that can run independantly from the module.
In the next parts, this standalone application will be adapted to run inside a PrestaShop page.

## 2- Cleanup

Supposing that the Vue.js workspace is the `_dev` folder:

* Remove the `_dev/public/` folder.
* In the `_dev/package.json` folder, remove the `serve` script.

## 3- Customization of the application for a PrestaShop context

In [the module structure]({{< ref "/9/modules/creation/module-file-structure.md" >}}), JavaScript
files must be stored in `views/js/`. We will ask the compiler to write the distributable files in there.

Create or edit `_dev/vue.config.js` with:

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  chainWebpack: (config) => {
    // Stop generating the HTML page
    config.plugins.delete('html');
    config.plugins.delete('preload');
    config.plugins.delete('prefetch');

    // Allow resolving images in the subfolder src/assets/ 
    config.resolve.alias.set('@', path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'));
  },
  css: {
    extract: false,
  },
  runtimeCompiler: true,
  productionSourceMap: false,
  filenameHashing: false,
  // These rules allow the files to be compiled and stored in the proper folder
  outputDir: '../views/',
  assetsDir: '',
  // ⚠️ Change this line with your module name
  publicPath: '../modules/<module_name>/views/',
};
```

{{% notice warning %}}
This configuration will delete all files present in the `views/js/` folder. Before going further,
make sure:

* there are no existing files that would be lost, or
* to write your generated files in an additional subfolder inside `views/js/` by modifying
`outputDir` & `publicPath`.
{{% /notice %}}

Then, the scripts available in the package.json can be replaced by these ones:

*modules/[module_name]/_dev/package.json*

```js
    "build": "vue-cli-service build --no-clean",
    "lint": "vue-cli-service lint --fix",
    "dev": "vue-cli-service build --no-clean --mode development --watch",
```

The new `dev` script allow to compile the JS files, and keep watching at any change that would happen
in the project directories. Everytime one file is saved, the compilation will run again immediately.

Testing the compilation of the files is done with:

```
$ npm run dev
```

After some time, a similar output should appear on the terminal once done:

```
$ npm run dev

[...]

```

## 4- Display of the application

The application is now ready to be integrated inside a page of PrestaShop.
There are several steps to complete:

* **Adding a div with the proper ID inside a template**

*modules/[module_name]/views/templates/admin/app.tpl*

```tpl
<link href="{$pathApp|escape:'htmlall':'UTF-8'}" rel=preload as=script>

<div id="app"></div>
<script src="{$chunkVendor|escape:'htmlall':'UTF-8'}"></script>
<script src="{$pathApp|escape:'htmlall':'UTF-8'}"></script>
```

Although this is not recommended, this example adds the JS file inside the template so the example remains short.
You should use `registerJavascript()` when possible.

* **Displaying the template content**

For an application integrated in an `AdminModuleController`:
```php
public function initContent()
{
  $this->context->smarty->assign([
      'pathApp' => $this->module->getPathUri() . 'views/js/app.js',
      'chunkVendor' => $this->module->getPathUri() . 'views/js/chunk-vendors.js',
  ]);
  $this->content = $this->context->smarty->fetch('module:modulename//views/templates/admin/app.tpl');
  parent::initContent();
}
```

Or for an application integrated in the module main class (i.e in the method `getContent()`):

*modules/[module_name]/[module_name].php*

```php
public function getContent()
{
  $this->context->smarty->assign([
      'pathApp' => $this->getPathUri() . 'views/js/app.js',
      'chunkVendor' => $this->getPathUri() . 'views/js/chunk-vendors.js',
  ]);

  return $this->context->smarty->fetch('module:modulename/views/templates/admin/app.tpl');
}
```

If the integration goes fine, the page should display the welcome screen of Vue.js:

{{< figure src="../img/bo-with-vuejs.png" title="Module configuration page with welcome page of Vue.js" >}}

The application is now running and ready to be modified with the module features.

The next steps can be done by relying on the [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) or website
of any JS dependency that will be added to the project.
