# Notable changes in PrestaShop 9.0

## PHP support

PrestaShop 9.0 now requires **PHP 8.1 minimum**, with support added for PHP 8.2 and 8.3.

- [Remove compatibility for php versions inferior to PHP 8.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32514)
- [Support for PHP 8.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29116)
- [Support for PHP 8.3](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34485)

## Core changes

### Symfony Upgrade

PrestaShop V9 has been upgraded to rely on Symfony 6.4, V8 was previously based on Symfony 4.4 so it's quite a big leap. As such the V9 includes all the breaking changes related to the Symfony Framework, you can see [more details about the changes in the core here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/33993) and if you can also check Symfony migration guides (see below).
Symfony 6.4 is the latest LTS version and will be supported until November 2026 for bug fixes, and November 2027 for security fixes.

- [UPGRADE FROM 6.3 to 6.4](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.4/UPGRADE-6.4.md)

### Removed dependencies

We followed Symfony recommendations and no longer use the `symfony/symfony` dependency but instead each sub package manually, the minimum version of PHP 8.1 also forced us to upgrade or removed some dependencies.
We used this occasion to clean the dependencies that are no longer used in the core (whether they are from symfony or not), if you need these dependencies in your modules you will have to integrate them in your module's dependencies.

- `guzzlehttp/guzzle` (replaced by Symfony HTTP client in the core)
- `league/tactician-bundle` (replaced by Symfony Messenger component)
- `pear/archive_tar`
- `sensio/framework-extra-bundle` (we now favor annotations in the core)
- `soundasleep/html2text`
- `swiftmailer/swiftmailer` (replaced by Symfony Mailer component in the core)
- `symfony/inflector`
- `symfony/notifier`
- `symfony/rate-limiter`
- `symfony/semaphore`
- `symfony/uid`
- `symfony/workflow`

@todo: explain changes about DI (controllers as services, injected container no longer the same, ...), new PrestaShopAdminController and deprecated FrameworkAdminBundleController

- [Removed method renderForm which is now used by the Symfony framework](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31994)
- [Maintain backward compatibility FrameworkBundleAdminController, but deprecated](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32450)

- [Replace AdminSecurity annotation with attributes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/35212)

## Migrated pages

The migration of pages imply several breaking changes, we won't detail all of them for each page but here is a summary:
- the legacy URL is no longer reachable, you are automatically redirected to the migrated page
- the legacy controller is removed along with its associated smarty templates
- the legacy hooks related to controller workflow are no longer called
- the page no longer uses smarty but twig

Here is the list of migrated pages in v9:

- International > Locations > States
- Shop parameters > Order settings > Statuses
- Orders > Shopping Carts
- Sell > Catalog > Attributes
- Sell > Catalog > Feature
- Sell > Catalog > Products (new version of the page introduce in PrestaShop V8 is now the only available one)
  - [edition of features use a new optimized data structure in the form](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34763)

## Breaking Changes

### `trans` method

Following [PrestaShop/PrestaShop#30415](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30415) the function `trans()` does NOT escape anymore strings. In v8 you could pass parameters like `htmspecialcharacters` or `addslashes` to `trans()` to perform additional escape, but it’s been removed.
It also affects the `l` function in Smarty.

Since [PrestaShop/PrestaShop#30415](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31900) the `trans` method always keep the behavior it had with the (now removed) `_raw` parameter, meaning the content is not modified anymore. You need to use `htmlspecialchars` on your parameters provided on input and on the returned string if you need to modify it.

### Some front controller now use `Presenter` classes

This changes the data passed to the smarty templates:

- [Category](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32653)
- [Manufacturer](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31309)
- [Supplier](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32634)
