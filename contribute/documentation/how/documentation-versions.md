# Documentation versions

The documentation content is tracked in the [Docs Repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs). Different versions of the documentation are available, that match the major versions of PrestaShop.

Contributions to the content, such as adding a new page, updating or fixing some existing reference, must be submitted as a Pull Request against the right branch on the repository.

- PrestaShop 1.7.x documentation is tracked in the `1.7.x` branch.
- PrestaShop 8.x documentation is tracked in the `8.x` branch.
- PrestaShop 9.x documentation is tracked in the `9.x` branch.

Consequently, if you want to update the 8.x documentation, you must submit your Pull Request against the `8.x` branch.

If your contribution is applicable for multiple PrestaShop versions, we suggest submitting it against the highest version first, then backporting the changes into previous versions in independent Pull Requests.
