# Writing Markdown

This site was created using the wonderful [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/), but the content itself is written using **Markdown**.

Don't worry, you don't need to know anything about Hugo or the Go language to write documentation. The Markdown syntax is basically plain text with some simple added syntax for styling.

If you don't know Markdown yet, have a look at this [quick Markdown guide from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Extended features: Shortcodes

Hugo uses special short codes for many things. [Read about them here]({{< relref "/9/contribute/documentation/shortcodes/" >}}).
