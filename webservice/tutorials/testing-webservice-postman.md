# Testing the Webservice with Postman

Postman is a powerful collaboration platform that simplifies the process of developing, testing, documenting, and sharing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) by providing a user-friendly interface and a comprehensive set of tools.

Some example collections of Postman requests on PrestaShop Webservice are [available on our repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/webservice-postman-examples). 

## Install Postman

Postman is available on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Please [follow instructions here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/).

## How to use these examples

### Clone the repository

First, clone the example repository locally: 

```shell
git clone git@github.com:PrestaShop/webservice-postman-examples.git
```

### Import a collection

Open Postman, and choose "File > Import". Then navigate to the cloned repository, and import a `JSON` collection.

The collection will be available in the sidebar:

![Postman sidebar](../assets/postman01.png)

### Set the Webservice URL and authorization key

Click on the collection title (`PrestaShop Webservice Demo Resource`), and navigate in the `Variables` tab:

![Postman sidebar](../assets/postman02.png)

- Overwrite the `webservice_key` with your webservice key (set value in the `CURRENT VALUE` cell).
- Overwrite the `webservice_url` with your PrestaShop instance url (set value in the `CURRENT VALUE` cell).

### Run examples

Confirm the connection with the Webservice is working properly by running a request:
